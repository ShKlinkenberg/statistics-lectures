<div class="column" style="width:70%;">
<p>The F-distribution, also known as Snedecor’s F distribution or the Fisher–Snedecor distribution (after Ronald Fisher and George W. Snedecor) is, in probability theory and statistics, a continuous probability distribution. The F-distribution arises frequently as the null distribution of a test statistic, most notably in the analysis of variance; see F-test.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-distribution">Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher FRS (17 February 1890 – 29 July 1962), known as R.A. Fisher, was an English statistician, evolutionary biologist, mathematician, geneticist, and eugenicist. Fisher is known as one of the three principal founders of population genetics, creating a mathematical and statistical basis for biology and uniting natural selection with Mendelian genetics.</p>

<h2>F-distribution</h2>
<p>So if the population is normally distributed (assumption of normality) the f-distribution represents the signal to noise ratio given a certain number of samples (<span class="math inline">\({df}_{model} = k - 1\)</span>) and sample size (<span class="math inline">\({df}_{error} = N - k\)</span>).</p>
<p>The F-distibution therefore is different for different sample sizes and number of groups.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{\sqrt{\frac{(d_1x)^{d_1}\,\,d_2^{d_2}} {(d_1x+d_2)^{d_1+d_2}}}} {x\operatorname{B}\left(\frac{d_1}{2},\frac{d_2}{2}\right)}\]</span></p>
