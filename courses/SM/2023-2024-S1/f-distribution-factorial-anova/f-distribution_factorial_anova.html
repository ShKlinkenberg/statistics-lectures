<p>The F-distribution, also known as Snedecor’s F distribution or the Fisher–Snedecor distribution (after Ronald Fisher and George W. Snedecor) is, in probability theory and statistics, a continuous probability distribution. The F-distribution arises frequently as the null distribution of a test statistic, most notably in the analysis of variance; see F-test.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-distribution">Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher FRS (17 February 1890 – 29 July 1962), known as R.A. Fisher, was an English statistician, evolutionary biologist, mathematician, geneticist, and eugenicist. Fisher is known as one of the three principal founders of population genetics, creating a mathematical and statistical basis for biology and uniting natural selection with Mendelian genetics.</p>
