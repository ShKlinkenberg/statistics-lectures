The F-distribution, also known as Snedecor's F distribution or the Fisher–Snedecor distribution (after Ronald Fisher and George W. Snedecor) is, in probability theory and statistics, a continuous probability distribution. The F-distribution arises frequently as the null distribution of a test statistic, most notably in the analysis of variance; see F-test.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-distribution)

Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher FRS (17 February 1890 – 29 July 1962), known as R.A. Fisher, was an English statistician, evolutionary biologist, mathematician, geneticist, and eugenicist. Fisher is known as one of the three principal founders of population genetics, creating a mathematical and statistical basis for biology and uniting natural selection with Mendelian genetics.

## Population distribution {.smaller .subsection}

```{r}
layout(matrix(c(2:6,1,1,7:8,1,1,9:13), 4, 4))

n  = 56    # Sample size
df = n - 1 # Degrees of freedom

mu    = 120
sigma = 15

IQ = seq(mu-45, mu+45, 1)

par(mar=c(4,2,0,0))  
plot(IQ, dnorm(IQ, mean = mu, sd = sigma), type='l', col="red")

n.samples = 12

for(i in 1:n.samples) {
  
  par(mar=c(2,2,0,0))  
  hist(rnorm(n, mu, sigma), main="", cex.axis=.5, col="red")
  
}
```

## F-statistic

$$F = \frac{{MS}_{model}}{{MS}_{error}} = \frac{{SIGNAL}}{{NOISE}}$$

So the $F$-statistic represents a signal to noise ratio by deviding the model variance component by the error variance component.

## A samples {.smaller}

Let's take two sample from our normal populatiion and calculate the F-value.

```{r}
x.1 = rnorm(n, mu, sigma)
x.2 = rnorm(n, mu, sigma)

data <- data.frame(group = rep(c("s1", "s2"), each=n), score = c(x.1,x.2))
	
F = summary(aov(lm(score ~ group, data)))[[1]]$F[1]
F
```

## More samples {.smaller .subsection}

let's take more samples and calculate the F-value every time.

```{r}
n.samples = 1000

f.values = vector()

for(i in 1:n.samples) {
  
  x.1 = rnorm(n, mu, sigma); x.1
  x.2 = rnorm(n, mu, sigma); x.2

  data <- data.frame(group = rep(c("s1", "s2"), each=n), score = c(x.1,x.2))
	
  f.values[i] = summary(aov(lm(score ~ group, data)))[[1]]$F[1]

}

k = 2
N = 2*n

df.model = k - 1
df.error = N - k

hist(f.values, freq = FALSE, main="F-values", breaks=100)
F = seq(0, 6, .01)
lines(F, df(F,df.model, df.error), col = "red")
```


## F-distribution {.smaller}

So if the population is normaly distributed (assumption of normality) the f-distribution represents the signal to noise ration given a certain number of samples (${df}_{model} = k - 1$) and sample size (${df}_{error} = N - k$).

The F-distibution therefore is different for different sample sizes and number of groups.

## F-distribution {.smaller}

```{r}
multiple.n  = c(5, 15, 30)
multiple.k  = c(2, 4, 6)
multiple.df.model = multiple.k - 1
multiple.df.error = multiple.n - multiple.k
col         = rainbow(length(multiple.df.model) * length(multiple.df.error))
F = seq(0, 10, .01)

plot(F,  df(F, multiple.df.model[1], multiple.df.error[1]), type = "l", 
     xlim = c(0,10), ylim = c(0,.85), 
     xlab = "F", ylab="density", 
     col  = col[1], main="F-distributions" )

dfs = expand.grid(multiple.df.model, multiple.df.error)

for(i in 2:dim(dfs)[1]) { 
  
  lines(F, df(F, dfs[i,1], dfs[i,2]), col=col[i])
  
  critical.f <- qf(.95, dfs[i,1], dfs[i,2])
  
  f.alpha <- seq(critical.f, 1000, .01)
  
  polygon(c(f.alpha, rev(f.alpha)), c(df(f.alpha, dfs[i,1], dfs[i,2]), f.alpha*0 ), col= rgb(1,.66,0, .5), border = col[i])
        
  } 
legend("topright", legend = paste("df model =",dfs[,1], "df error =", dfs[,2]), lty=1, col = col, cex=.75)
```
